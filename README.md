Because the height of the ball's rebound cannot be precisely represented by an integer of the int type, and since bool values represent either true or false, and str values represent text, none of these options are suitable for expressing the digital height. The float type can precisely represent the exact height of the rebound, making it the most suitable type. It is most appropriate to use the integer type for the number of rebounds, because the number of rebounds cannot be a decimal. Just as it is impossible for a ball to rebound 4.6 times. And neither the bool value nor the str value can represent the number of rebounds.
