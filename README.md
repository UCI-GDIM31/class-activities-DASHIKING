### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
Because the height of the ball's rebound cannot be precisely represented by an integer of the int type, and since bool values represent either true or false, and str values represent text, none of these options are suitable for expressing the digital height. The float type can precisely represent the exact height of the rebound, making it the most suitable type. It is most appropriate to use the integer type for the number of rebounds, because the number of rebounds cannot be a decimal. Just as it is impossible for a ball to rebound 4.6 times. And neither the bool value nor the str value can represent the number of rebounds.

### W3
Table6  I will set the input as the time when the player hits the screen, and the output will be the difference between the player's hitting time and the beat.
Class Just like an architectural design blueprint, it defines the structure, function and layout of the house, but it is not the house itself. You can use this blueprint to build many houses. Component is a specific house built according to the blueprint. Although they all follow the same design, each house can have different colors, furniture, occupants, etc. Member's variables This refers to the specific features of each house. It's like saying that a house has several windows. Methods refers what the house could do, like you can sleep in the house and control the lights on and off.

### W4 
Table 8. line5 defines a float value called moved_speed and it's value is 1.0f. The code enables the character to move forward and backward along the Z-axis when the W/S keys are pressed, with the speed controlled by _moveSpeed, and the movement is frame rate independent. The character will begin to move in the sprite (0.0) due to line 25.
